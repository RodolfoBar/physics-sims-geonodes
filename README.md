# physics-sims-geonodes

An attempt to create all different physics simulations in blenders Simulation Geonodes.

## Requirements:

Blender 3.6.0 Beta or above

## Installation:

Step 1: Clone Repository

Step 2: Open whichever Node tree you want in Blender

If you would like to just view the results of the geonodes, you can open the Demo.blend which has all the nodetrees linked to it

## Implemented Physics Simulations:

- Elastic collisions between spherical particles of varying Radius and Mass
- 2D implementation included. However not final.

## To be worked on:

- Fluid Simulations
- Smoke Simulation
- General Soft Body Simulation
- Snow Simulations
